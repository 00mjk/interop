AUVSI SUAS: Sample Interoperability Implementation
================================================================================

This directory contains a sample implementation of interoperability. This should
not be shared with teams. This implementation can be used as blackbox monitoring
of the running system, to load test the deployment configuration, or test
components which are otherwise difficult to test.

You can use the code by executing:
python interop_client.py localhost:80 0.1 testuser testpass
