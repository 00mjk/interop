Interoperability Client
=======================

The judges have provided a sample Client which can be used to integrate with
the interoperability server. This is provided to help teams integrate so that
certain components can become a requirement and so that more advanced tasks can
be defined.

TODO(pmtischler): Refer to sample and load test for how to use the library.
