System Management
=================

This section describes how to configure and use the AUVSI SUAS
competition system. Teams will need to use these sections frequently.

#. :doc:`start_stop`.
   The automatic setup configures Apache which starts the server at
   machine startup. This section is optional and describes how to start
   the development server.
#. :doc:`configure`.
   How to configure the server to set parameters like the server
   message, and the number and types of obstacles. It also can be used
   to view log data and view posted Unmanned Aerial System (UAS)
   telemetry.
#. :doc:`interop_example`.
   An example of how to perform interoperability with the competition
   server. This approach is extremely inefficient and is insufficient to
   achieve the required update rates, but it demonstrates how to make
   requests.
